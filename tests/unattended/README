Instructions to run uit tests:

    - All tests are defined in files as such: tests-{script_name}.sh, where {script_name}.sh is the file we are testing.
    - To run the tests we use the auxiliary script `unit-tests.sh`, which creates a clean docker environment on which to run the tests.
    - Docker must be installed and running in the system and the user must have access.
    - The docker image is kept, it isn't destroyed when the script finishes. If something in the Dockerfile is changed, run with `-r` to rebuild
