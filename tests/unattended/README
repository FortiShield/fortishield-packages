Instructions to run uit tests:

    All tests are defined in files as such: tests-{script_name}.sh, where {script_name}.sh is the file we are testing.
    To run the tests we use the auxiliar script unit-tests.sh, which creates a clean docker environment on which to run the tests.
    Docker must be installed and running in the system and the user must have access.
